Things to do:

* Migrate to [[m:API]] (rather than QueryAPI), when API is completed
* Use serialisation for saving settings for IRC monitor (like AWB)
* Enable other languages for IRC monitor
* Finish implementing dotnetwikibot functions to allow moving/deleting articles - doubtful, better add this functionality to WebControl
* Fix Elonka's bug: escape chars reconversion during serialization/deserialization
* Make RETF correct visible parts of wikilinks and image captions
* Make DB scanner hide some patterns when needed.
* Do something about faulty plugin options serialization.
* Do not remove underscore from links to pages that transclde {{Underscore}} and {{Lowercase and underscore}}.
