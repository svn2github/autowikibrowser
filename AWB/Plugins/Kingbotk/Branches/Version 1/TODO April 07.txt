Steve has a headache!

*Check the changes to BadPages log/uploading, and logic when selecting the check boxes
*Check the changes to the BotMode checkbox and that's it's always correctly (in)visible/(en/dis)abled
*Sam's logging error form needs to be bigger. (Perhaps offer to redo failed tasks?)
*Logging error form needs to keep app alive if error occurs on when-closing upload (perhaps displaying modally if app was exiting? or cancel exit?)
*Add a Hide linklabel to the Log Upload form
*Why isn't the LED blue when uploading?
*Move and reformat the ETC label
*Get notification of username change by handling the event in Tools.Variables. See if there's any other events in that class we could benefit from handling

*Test the changes to the IAWBPluginForm interface and see what else we can streamline in the plugin as a result of the changes
