So far it is not ready to be released as end-user package:
it has quick revert and warning features but no checklist for limiting
using this tool by vandals/trolls.

* Add user functions (block, see contribs etc.)
* Move a lot of hardcoded things to settings.
* Add support of other projects.
* Make code to guess new section name if needed when issuing warnings.
